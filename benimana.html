        July 20, 2017 - The American Healthcare Informatics Management Association (AHIMA) has released <br> a standardized model for patient health data access requests in an effort to streamline the process, according to an organization statement emailed to journalists.

The form is reportedly first <br> of its kind, and will set a standard across the industry for how patients can request health data access.<br> The Patient Request for Health Information form is HIPAA-compliant and can be customized across different facilities.

AHIMA developed the form in response to an industry-wide call for a clearer and more <br> intuitive process for patients to request access to their medical records. The organization said it’s heard from multiple industry stakeholders that this process is confusing for patients and keeps patients from utilizing their rights to their information.
